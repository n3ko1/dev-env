# .dotfiles

Tested on: Linux Mint 19.1 "Tessa" - Cinnamon (64-bit)

set up basic environment on new machine

I try to keep it simple and close to default (except for gdb)

General:

```
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh # act on prompts
vim .zshrc # edit plugins and theme (see .zshsrc)
```

If in VMWare Player:

```
sudo apt install open-vm-tools open-vm-tools-desktop
```

Must have:
tmux
zsh / oh-my-zsh
vim
fzf
